# 🧍‍♂️ Crowd Simulator

A real-time crowd simulation tool built to model and visualize human-like crowd behavior in various environments. This project can be used for research, safety planning, gaming, or virtual experience simulation.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔄 Real-time crowd movement simulation
- 🧠 Agent-based modeling
- ⚠️ Collision avoidance between individuals
- 🔍 Adjustable simulation parameters (speed, density, environment layout)
- 🌐 Environment map rendering
- 📈 Data logging for analytics and testing
- 🎮 Interactive UI (if applicable)
